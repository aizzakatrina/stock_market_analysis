# Stock Market Analysis

 Source code file: [/scripts/stock_market_analysis.bas](/scripts/stock_market_analysis.bas)

  A VBA script that analyzes stock market data.

The script loops through each year of stock data and calculates the total amount of volume each stock had over the year, the yearly change between the opening and closing price, the yearly change as a percentage, and the total volume. 

The script then locates the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume.
